        I  have loved music since I was very young, and I have composed music 
        for as long as I can remember. I like experimenting with layered vocals,
        various production styles, unique synthesizer sounds, and intricate melodies
        that are unpredictable. Furthermore, I like painting a picture with the sounds
        I choose to use. I always think of imagery behind all my music, and I try to channel
        that imagery or art in the way I utilize instruments and construct melodies 
        and harmonies. <br>
        <br>
